## How to: create a region
Defining regions is one of the key parts of the plugin as they then allow you to add or remove flags.<br>
Here are the steps you need to take:
1. Run the `/rg create <NAME>` command to define a new region
2. Now define the region area with `/wg pos1` and `/wg pos2`
> **Note**<br>
> Regions are **2D** so you don't need to define also the height (y)!
3. Manage flags with `/flags <NAME>`

## How to: add a player to the whitelist
Easy:
```
/rg player <REGION NAME> <PLAYER NAME>
```
